# PyBay

### Contributing

 - Create a new branch from main
 - Open the new branch in Codespace
 - Run a temporary instance on Codespace server in the PyBay subdirectory ( `cd PyBay`) and (`lektor server -f webpack`)
 - Make changes to code
 - Check for errors; check that the site displays correctly in multiple browsers and mobile.
 - Inspect with other support tools (e.g., Lighthouse, https://metatags.io/ for share cards, social metadata. etc.) make sure share cards display correctly and metadata is correct.
 - LinkedIn Post Inspector (https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/) gives a more detailed view of errors, but does not work through redirects.  You can make your GitHub Codespace Public and test (same box as 'open browser' link when you first run it), and also check after changes are in production.
 - Commit and push to your branch (`git add -u`) (`git commit -m "your update descriptions here"`) and (`git push`)
 - Open PR and request review before merging with the main branch
 - After comments and requested fixes are made, merge PR to the main branch.
 - Close related issues on GitHub, be sure to tag each issue with the PR number.
